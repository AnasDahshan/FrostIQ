# FrostIQ

FrostIQ is a small device designed for people who have old non-smart fridges and want to experience some of the features of a smart fridge without paying for a new one. Similar to how a Xiaomi Mi Box S Streaming or an Apple TV can turn a non-smart TV into a smart TV, FrostIQ can make a non-smart fridge smarter.

In addition to providing smart fridge features, FrostIQ also generates recipes based on the products found in the fridge. This can be a helpful tool for those who struggle with meal planning or are looking for creative ways to use up ingredients.
